Q: What is latency?
A: The time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it.

Q: What is bandwidth?
A: bandwidth is the maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path.

C: bandwidth is the [maximum throughput] of a logical or physical communication path.

C: [Propagation delay] - Amount of time required for a message to travel from the sender to the receiver, which is a function of distance over speed with which the signal propagates; Dicated by distance and medium.

C: [Trasmission delay] - Amount of time required to push all the packet's bits into the link, which is a function of the packet's length and data rate of the link; dictated by the available data rate of the trasmitting link.

C: [Processing delay] - Amount of time required to process the packet header, check for bit-level errors, and determine the packet's destination.

C: [Queuing delay] - Amount of time the packet is waiting in the queue until it can be processed.

Q: What is the last mile problem?
A: In the final segemnts of a telecommunications network, signifcant latency is introduced.

C: [Latency] not [bandwidth] is the performance bottleneck for most websites.

Q: What distinct advantage do optical fibers have over metal wires?
A: Each fiber can carry many wavelenghts (channels) of light through a process called wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM); bandwidth then is per channel data rate times number of channels.

C: High variablity of [throughput] and [latency] is an inherent property of our data networks - predicting, managing, and adapting to the continuously changing "network weather" is a complex task.

Q: How can we improve the performance of our applications?
A: Reduce round trips, move data closer to the client, and build applications that can hide the latency thorugh caching, pre-fetching, and other techniques.
